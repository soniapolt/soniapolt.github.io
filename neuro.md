      My PhD work centered around how the human brain processes visual information over the visual field: how salient items "pop" from their background, how figures are segmented from the background, and how directed attention interacts with those processes. I worked primarily in early cortical (V1-hV4) and subcortical (LGN) areas, where information is first transformed after entering the eye. I ran neuroimaging and psychophysics experiments, and built statistical and parametric models of brain signals.

  - title: Computations of Face Recognition

        In my postdoc work, I determined how the same sort of basic computations --  integrating spatial information within receptive fields -- impact vision at later stages, when we recognize complex objects like faces. We found that this sort of spatial processing is responsible for core behavioral signatures of face recognition, "holistic" perception, which dictates that we're better at recognizing whole faces than individual features, and are worse at recognizing upside-down faces (more so than other objects!). This project combined neuroimaging, computational modeling, and behavioral experiments to predict very specific recognition behavior from independent brain measurements on the same people.
